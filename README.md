# Io in a day

@benjamintillett and I pair up to figure out the weird and wonderful world of [Io](http://iolanguage.org), a prototypical language introduced to us as part of our "learn *n* languages in *n* days" sprint at Makers Academy.

Io was chosen because it's a prototypical language, and as such has a lot to inform us about learning and using JavaScript. It's elegant and minimal, but has an incredble array of libraries and assets that can be pulled in.

It even has a [testing library](github.com/quag/iospec2) â€“ though it looks as though it hasn't been updated in a few years. Maybe it's time to write one.
